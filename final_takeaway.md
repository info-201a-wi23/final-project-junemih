# Final Takeaways

The analysis of the power of music has revealed that music is a universal language that can connect people from different backgrounds and cultures. Music has the ability to evoke emotions, enhance cognitive function, and impact the human brain in various ways. As discussed, music can be used in a variety of settings, including education, therapy, and social environments, to improve mental and physical wellbeing.

## Takeaway 1
Our analysis shows that a song's characteristics, such as tempo, energy, and danceability, correlate with people's reactions when listening to the song. For example, fast-paced songs with high energy levels and danceability tended to make people feel more energized and motivated. On the other hand, slower songs with lower energy and danceability levels were more likely to evoke feelings of relaxation and sadness. Therefore, it is important for musicians and producers to consider these characteristics when creating music that will resonate with their audience. This ties into the real world because places such as EDM concerts and your local cafe play different types of music geared towards their customers. EDM concerts play high energy songs which correlates with the loudness of the songs (shown on graph1) because their target audience is geared towards high energy dancers. On the other hand, cafe's play soft jazz or lofi music because their target audience is geared towards people who are trying to get some work done or there to relax with a cup of coffee/tea. Therefore, their song characteristic of choice is low volume which is correlated with low energy (shown on graph1).

## Takeaway 2
In regards to how do the acousticness, instrumentalness, and liveness affect the song energy, acousticness and instrumentalness have a negative impact on the energy of a song, whereas liveness has a positive impact. This means that songs with high levels of acousticness and instrumentalness tend to have a more relaxed and low energy sounds. On the other hand, songs with high levels of liveness, such as those recorded in front of a live audience, tend to have a more exciting and intense sound, which can be ideal for energetic playlists. This can be used by artist and producers when creating a song to have more acoustic and instrumental if they are going for a lower energy song or more of a liveliness if they want to create lots of energy in their music. 

## Takeaway 3
While there is a correlation between a song's duration and mood and its popularity, our analysis showed that these factors do not solely determine a song's success. Other factors such as the artist's reputation, marketing, and overall musical quality also play important roles in determining a song's popularity. Therefore, it is important for musicians and producers to focus on creating high-quality music that is both unique and appealing to their target audience, rather than solely relying on duration and mood as determinants of success. It is also important for both musicians and producers to have quality marketing campaigns to boost the popularity of songs. As shown on graph3, there are a couple out liars who have done exceptionally well even though their songs are over 5+ minutes or under 2. This is through their marketing strategy and quality of music.

In conclusion, our analysis has shown that a song's characteristics, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, and mood are all important factors that can influence people's reactions when listening to the song and its overall popularity. However, it is important to consider these factors in conjunction with other important elements such as musical quality and marketing to ensure that a song achieves success. At the end of the day, no matter how much data and research is done, only the artist and passion can make the song. By keeping these key takeaways in mind, musicians and producers can create music that resonates with their audience and stands out in today's competitive music industry. For instance, understanding the relationship between a song's characteristics and people's reactions can help music producers and artists create songs that their fans will relate to. Analyzing this can help find trends and patterns in the music industry before competition catches on the wave. Understanding their target audience can lead to increased revenue for music labels, streaming platforms, and artists themselves. All and all, even though this scenario is geared towards producers and artist, this analysis can be applied towards other industries to have a better understanding of their customers.
