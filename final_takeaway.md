#Final Takeaways
The analysis of the power of music has revealed that music is a universal language that can connect people from different backgrounds and cultures. Music has the ability to evoke emotions, enhance cognitive function, and impact the human brain in various ways. As discussed, music can be used in a variety of settings, including education, therapy, and social environments, to improve mental and physical wellbeing.

Our analysis shows that a song's characteristics, such as tempo, energy, and danceability, correlate with people's reactions when listening to the song. For example, fast-paced songs with high energy levels and danceability tended to make people feel more energized and motivated. On the other hand, slower songs with lower energy and danceability levels were more likely to evoke feelings of relaxation and sadness. Therefore, it is important for musicians and producers to consider these characteristics when creating music that will resonate with their audience. This ties into the real world because places such as EDM concerts and your local cafe play different types of music geared towards their customers. EDM concerts play high energy songs which correlates with the loudness of the songs (shown on graph1) because their target audience is geared towards high energy dancers. On the other hand, cafe's play soft jazz or lofi music because their target audience is geared towards people who are trying to get some work done or there to relax with a cup of coffee/tea. Therefore, their song characteristic of choice is low volume which is correlated with low energy (shown on graph1).


In regards to popularity, it is revealed that the popularity of a song is influenced by its duration and mood. Popular songs tended to be shorter in duration, with an average length of 3 to 4 minutes. Additionally, popular songs tended to have a positive mood, with high levels of energy and danceability. This has to do with the serotonin released when listening to catchy songs and beat drops. However, it is important to note that there are exceptions to this trend, as some longer and more somber songs have also achieved great popularity. Also, sad songs need to be taken into account as well because these have characteristics of low energy, low daneability, and a little more on the speechy side. This is because people can relate to the song/feel a deeper connection to the lyrics. But, overall popularity of a song can be determined based on the energy it brings depicted by the high clusters of energy on graph2.


While there is a correlation between a song's duration and mood and its popularity, our analysis showed that these factors do not solely determine a song's success. Other factors such as the artist's reputation, marketing, and overall musical quality also play important roles in determining a song's popularity. Therefore, it is important for musicians and producers to focus on creating high-quality music that is both unique and appealing to their target audience, rather than solely relying on duration and mood as determinants of success. It is also important for both musicians and producers to have quality marketing campaigns to boost the popularity of songs. As shown on graph3, there are a couple out liars who have done exceptionally well even though their songs are over 5+ minutes or under 2. This is through their marketing strategy and quality of music. 


In conclusion, our analysis has shown that a song's characteristics, duration, and mood are all important factors that can influence people's reactions when listening to the song and its overall popularity. However, it is important to consider these factors in conjunction with other important elements such as musical quality and marketing to ensure that a song achieves success. Using this analysis, we can see how imporant music choice has on our daily lives. By keeping these key takeaways in mind, musicians and producers can create music that resonates with their audience and stands out in today's competitive music industry. These insights can help cook up better songs that will gain more attraction or build the perfect playlist to attract more customers for a business.
